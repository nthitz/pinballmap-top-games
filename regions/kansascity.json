The transparent ramps are great and the playfield overall is super fun. FYI, this is a older machine and I did notice a two technical issues that need servicing. The biggest issue is some of the active drop in bumpers are not working at all, which affects scoring and playability (nothing serious but something that would be straight forward to service). Also, on drop in, the ball tends to fall in the far left inlane which probably means the playfield needs to be leveled a bit.

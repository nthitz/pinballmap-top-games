Instead, they carry over to the next game and the machine doesn‚Äôt realize the locked balls from the previous game are still in the lock. If you get all three of them in the lock then you have to wait about 15 seconds for the ball search to eject them out. \r\n\r\nBut on the plus side, the replay is at an easy 3 million points.
